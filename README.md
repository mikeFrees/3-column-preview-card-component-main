## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass/Scss
- Npm
- AutoPrefixer
- Normalize.css

### What I learned

I aquired a deeper understanding of how to use Npm and started learning about grunt. 

I also learned how to import and use fonts via npm but ran into a problem with my deployment on github pages. I exluded the files from the node_modules folder to avoid encumbering my repo with all the dependencies but i did not realize that by doing this my files would no longer have acces to the ressources they needed(font files and normalize.css).

I also have a better understanding of how to write scss and how to use the css pseudo classes and elements.

### Continued development

For my next project i would like to set up a good development proces with grunt and understand how to build a gruntfile. And start looking into Typescript because the type declartation makes me think of when i used to programm in c# which makes me feel confortable.
